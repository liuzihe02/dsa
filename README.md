# Data Structures and Algorithims
Personal notes for data structures and algorithims. Initial notes based off neetcode.io courses. Notes are stored as Jupyter Notebooks.

These notes are mostly focused on leetcode and interviews for various tech companies

## Question Bank

Zack Light made a [video](https://youtu.be/deJBbSdLzjo?si=ra7LI-TYvR_5w3SP) covering the actual algorithims asked by FAANG. These are pretty useful.

Also check out the [company wise repo](https://github.com/liquidslr/leetcode-company-wise-problems) for the raw dataset on company questionbank, which are updated frequently

And Zack's [youtube repo](https://github.com/Zackhardtoname/youtube_share) which houses analysis on company questions. I have cloned these repos locally, and used `Live Server` to view the question distribution. View these visualizations for the type questions actually asked.
