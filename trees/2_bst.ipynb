    "# Binary Search Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search Trees (BST) are a variation of binary trees with the addition of a sorted property. The property is that every node in the *left subtree is smaller* than the root and every node in the *right subtree is greater* than the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a recursive property, meaning that it applies to every node in the tree - all nodes in the left subtree of this node is smaller and right is larger etc . This sorted property makes the BST like a sorted array\n",
    "\n",
    "> values in a BST should be unique\n",
    "> BST doesnt have to be complete (completeness is explained in heaps section)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "With BSTs we can search in $O(log(n))$ which is the height of tree, just like Binary Search in an array. BSTs are often preferred over sorted arrays as you can insert/delete in $O(log(n))$ time. This isn't possible with sorted arrays which require $O(n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BST Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In binary search, if the target was less than the middle element, we search left space. If the target was less than the middle element, we search right space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in BSTs, we recursively search the right subtree if our target is greater than the current node and the left subtree if our target is smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we reach the `target` node, then return `True`. Else we return `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def search(root, target):\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "    Subtle point: \n",
    "    If the target node actually exists, then this method will take ONLY ONE CORRECT PATH downward and reach True and start returning\n",
    "    If the target node doesn't exist, this method will take down ONE PATH and reach a leaf node (that is not the target) and reach False and start returning\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "    # This executes when we've gone past a leaf node, and it isnt the target  - basically reached a leaf node\n",
    "    if not root:\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #will execute when itself isnt None\n",
    "    if target > root.val:\n",
    "        return search(root.right, target)\n",
    "    elif target < root.val:\n",
    "        return search(root.left, target)\n",
    "    #equality case\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we reach a null node, we return false because the target does not exist in the current tree.\n",
    "2. If the target is greater than the current node, we search the right subtree.\n",
    "3. If the target is less than the current node, we search the left subtree.\n",
    "4. If the target is equal to the current node, we return true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts 2 and 3 are the recursive calls, while Part 1 and 4 are the base cases\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notes*\n",
    "- *Single* Path Exploration: the BST Search only explores a single path from root to a leaf node.\n",
    "- No competing `True` or `False` returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, this one returns the node object and makes more sense.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def search(root, target):\n",
    "    # Base Cases: root is null or target is present at root\n",
    "    if root is None or root.val == target:\n",
    "        return root\n",
    "\n",
    "    # target is greater than root's val\n",
    "    if root.val < target:\n",
    "        return search(root.right, target)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # target is smaller than root's val\n",
    "        return search(root.left, target)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a balanced binary tree, our search algorithm will run in $O(h)$ time, where the height of tree `h` is approximately $log(n)$. Balanced binary tree means that, for any node, the height of the left-subtree is equal to the height of the right-subtree, or there is a difference of 1. In a balanced tree, we can eliminate half the nodes each time, which results in $O(log n)$, for reasons we discussed in the merge sort and binary search lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case we have a skewed tree, where the height of the tree is equal to the number of nodes. In this case, the time complexity will be $O(n)$ - this is basically a linked list."
